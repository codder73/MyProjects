--THE BATTLE OF NINJAS--

The battle of ninjas is a 2D anime game based on "NARUTO ANIME".
I have made this game using python and pygame for ""hacktoon hackathon""


PLAYER 1 :: {NARUTO}

To play this game as player 1 which is naruto the user will be using the 4 arrow keys.
Which are up,down,left and right.


PLAYER 2:: {SASKUE}

To play this game as player 2 which is saskue the player has to use W,S,A and D keys of keyboard.


# Rules:
In this game the two players which are naruto and saskue will race to collect the power_orbs. As the name suggest power_orbs, So the first player to get 75 orbs will get power up. 
If the player which get the power up which can be NARUTO or SASKUE touch the other player will win the game.

And a message will pop up like "Naruto has killed Saskue" or vice-versa.
